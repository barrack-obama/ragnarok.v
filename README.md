# ragnarok.v
An osu! server emulator, in V!

### Note: Simon, the main coder of Ragnarok.v decided to stop working on this, so I, Aoba will try to continue the project.

Ragnarok.v is both a bancho and /web/ server, written in V!

Ragnarok will provide more stablibilty™️ and way faster performance than Ripple's bancho emulator (Second login takes about 4-5ms).
